# Programming6121-Second-semester-Exam
This is my second semester exam:
In This project was created as part of my Java programming exam.
It includes a complete Product Sales Report application that uses two-dimensional arrays, classes, and an interface to calculate the total, average, maximum, and minimum product sales over a two-year period.
I also implemented JUnit 5 unit tests to verify that each method (total, average, max, and min) works correctly.
The project follows good programming practices, with a clear structure, clean code, and proper documentation.
